This repo is meant to be the starting point for somebody who likes to use dockerized multi-container Zammad on Kubernetes.
The Zammad Docker image uses the stable branch of Zammad's Git repo.

The used Docker images are hosted on `Dockerhub <https://hub.docker.com/r/zammad/zammad-docker-compose/>`_.

You need the Helm binary installed / initialized and at least 4 GB of free RAM in the Kubernetes cluster run the containers.
